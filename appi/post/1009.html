<div><h1>Why A Team Of 18 Colleagues Quit From Wendy's On The Same Day TikTok Goes Viral</h1>
<p>Corona has led millions of people to leave their jobs. Especially food service and retail industries are losing workers rapidly.&nbsp;</p><p>The labor shortage has made the employers consider an increase on the hourly wages for fast food workers&nbsp;by 14% in 2020. But it still wasn‚Äôt enough to keep fast-food chains running like they did before the pandemic. McDonald‚Äôs, Popeyes and Burger King have been forced to&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;their working hours in certain locations.</p><p>Furthermore, a former Wendy‚Äôs manager TikTok went viral. His video revealed how the working conditions made him and 17 other colleagues quit the job on the same day. Lately, this trend named as the&nbsp;Great Resignation, has become very familiar.</p><p>The employees claim to be unsatisfied because they were neglected during the pandemic. Their health was at risk due to the long work hours that were payed little - only $14.77 per hour.</p><p>That's why the TikTok user whose name&nbsp;is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mintjuul.666" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mintjuul.666</a>, has shown his side of the story. He claimed that he lost his assistant general manager, general manager, and six coworkers throughout the pandemic. Meantime the man continued working as a shift manager. And gradually was promoted to be an assistant general manager. During that period he took on 85-hour work weeks with no days off.</p>
